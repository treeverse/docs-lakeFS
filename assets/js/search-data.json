This includes basic CRUD operations against repositories and objects, as well as versioning related operations such as branching, merging, committing, and reverting changes to data. Storage Adapter . The Storage Adapter is an abstraction layer for communicating with any underlying object store. Its implementations allow compatibility with many types of underlying storage such as S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage, or non-production usages such as the local storage adapter. See the roadmap for information on the future plans for storage compatibility. Graveler . The Graveler handles lakeFS versioning by translating lakeFS addresses to the actual stored objects. To learn about the data model used to store lakeFS metadata, see the versioning internals page. Authentication &amp; Authorization Service . The Auth service handles the creation, management, and validation of user credentials and RBAC policies. The credential scheme, along with the request signing logic, are compatible with AWS IAM (both SIGv2 and SIGv4). Currently, the Auth service manages its own database of users and credentials and doesn’t use IAM in any way. Hooks Engine . The Hooks Engine enables CI/CD for data by triggering user defined Actions that will run during commit/merge. UI . The UI layer is a simple browser-based client that uses the OpenAPI server.

    "content": "Deprecated Feature: Having heard the feedback from the community, we are planning to replace the below manual steps with an automated process. You can read more about it here. Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Amazon Athena works directly above S3 and can’t access lakeFS. Tables created using Athena aren’t readable by lakeFS. However, tables stored in lakeFS (that were created with glue/hive) can be queried by Athena. To support querying data from lakeFS with Amazon Athena, we will use create-symlink, one of the metastore commands in lakectl. create-symlink receives a source table, destination table, and the table location. It performs two actions: . | It creates partitioned directories with symlink files in the underlying S3 bucket. | It creates a table in Glue catalog with symlink format type and location pointing to the created symlinks. | . Note .lakectl.yaml file should be configured with the proper hive/glue credentials. For more information . create-symlink receives a table in glue or hive pointing to lakeFS and creates a copy of the table in glue. The table data will use the SymlinkTextInputFormat, which will point to the lakeFS repository storage namespace. You will be able to query your data with Athena without copying any data. However, the symlinks table will only show the data that existed during the copy. If the table changed in lakeFS, you need to run create-symlink again for your changed to be reflected in Athena. Example: . Let’s assume that some time ago, we created a hive table my_table that is stored in lakeFS repo example under branch main, using the command: . CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE `my_table`( `id` bigint, `key` string ) PARTITIONED BY (YEAR INT, MONTH INT) LOCATION 's3://example/main/my_table'; WITH (format = 'PARQUET', external_location 's3a://example/main/my_table' ); . The repository example has the S3 storage space s3://my-bucket/my-repo-prefix/. After inserting some data into it, the object structure under lakefs://example/main/my_table looks as follows: . To query that table with Athena, you need to use the create-symlink command as follows: . lakectl metastore create-symlink \\ --repo example \\ --branch main \\ --path my_table \\ --from-client-type hive \\ --from-schema default \\ --from-table my_table \\ --to-schema default \\ --to-table my_table . The command will generate two notable outputs: . | For each partition, the command will create a symlink file: | . aws s3 ls s3://my-bucket/my-repo-prefix/my_table/ --recursive 2021-11-23 17:46:29 0 my-repo-prefix/my_table/symlinks/example/main/my_table/year=2021/month=11/symlink.txt 2021-11-23 17:46:29 60 my-repo-prefix/my_table/symlinks/example/main/my_table/year=2021/month=12/symlink.txt 2021-11-23 17:46:30 60 my-repo-prefix/my_table/symlinks/example/main/my_table/year=2022/month=1/symlink.txt .

This integration can be especially useful if you already have an existing authentication system in place, as it allows you to reuse that system instead of maintaining a new one. To configure a Remote Authenticator see the configuration fields. API Server Authentication . Authenticating against the API server is done using a key-pair, passed via Basic Access Authentication. All HTTP requests must carry an Authorization header with the following structure: . Authorization: Basic &lt;base64 encoded access_key_id:secret_access_key&gt; . For example, assuming my access_key_id is my_access_key_id and my secret_access_key is my_secret_access_key, we’d send the following header with every request: .

This way, lakeFS will be able to create repositories only under this specific path (see: Storage Namespace). | lakeFS will try to assume the role [IAM_ROLE]. | . If required lakeFS can operate without accessing the data itself, this permission section is useful if you are using presigned URLs mode or the lakeFS Hadoop FileSystem Spark integration. Since this FileSystem performs many operations directly on the storage, lakeFS requires less permissive permissions, resulting in increased security. lakeFS always requires permissions to access the _lakefs prefix under your storage namespace, in which metadata is stored (learn more). By setting this policy without presign mode you’ll be able to perform only metadata operations through lakeFS, meaning that you’ll not be able to use lakeFS to upload or download objects. Specifically you won’t be able to: . | Upload objects using the lakeFS GUI (Works with presign mode) | Upload objects through Spark using the S3 gateway | Run lakectl fs commands (unless using presign mode with --pre-sign flag) | Use Actions and Hooks | . { \"Id\": \"[POLICY_ID]\", \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"lakeFSObjects\", \"Action\": [ \"s3:GetObject\", \"s3:PutObject\" ], \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:s3:::[STORAGE_NAMESPACE]/_lakefs/*\" ], \"Principal\": { \"AWS\": [\"arn:aws:iam::[ACCOUNT_ID]:role/[IAM_ROLE]\"] } }, { \"Sid\": \"lakeFSBucket\", \"Action\": [ \"s3:ListBucket\", \"s3:GetBucketLocation\" ], \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Resource\": [\"arn:aws:s3:::[BUCKET]\"], \"Principal\": { \"AWS\": [\"arn:aws:iam::[ACCOUNT_ID]:role/[IAM_ROLE]\"] } } ] } . We can use presigned URLs mode without allowing access to the data from the lakeFS server directly. We can achieve this by using condition keys such as aws:referer, aws:SourceVpc and aws:SourceIp. For example, assume the following scenario: . | lakeFS is deployed outside the company (i.e lakeFS cloud or other VPC not vpc-123) | We don’t want lakeFS to be able to access the data, so we use presign URL, we still need lakeFS role to be able to sign the URL. | We want to allow access from the internal company VPC: vpc-123. | . { \"Sid\": \"allowLakeFSRoleFromCompanyOnly\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::[ACCOUNT_ID]:role/[IAM_ROLE]\" }, \"Action\": [ \"s3:GetObject\", \"s3:PutObject\", ], \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:s3:::[BUCKET]/*\", ], \"Condition\": { \"StringEquals\": { \"aws:SourceVpc\": \"vpc-123\" } } } . | . Alternative: use an AWS user . lakeFS can authenticate with your AWS account using an AWS user, using an access key and secret.

The following authentication methods are supported: . | Managed Service Identity (MSI) | Service Principal RBAC | Azure CLI | . For deployments inside the Azure ecosystem it is recommended to use a managed identity. More information on authentication methods and environment variables can be found here . How to Create Service Principal for Resource Group . It is recommended to create a resource group that consists of all the resources lakeFS should have access to. Using a resource group will allow dynamic removal/addition of services from the group, effectively providing/preventing access for lakeFS to these resources without requiring any changes in configuration in lakeFS or providing lakeFS with any additional credentials. The minimal role required for the service principal is “Storage Blob Data Contributor” . The following Azure CLI command creates a service principal for a resource group called “lakeFS” with permission to access (read/write/delete) Blob Storage resources in the resource group and with an expiry of 5 years . az ad sp create-for-rbac \\ --role \"Storage Blob Data Contributor\" \\ --scopes /subscriptions/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/resourceGroups/lakeFS --years 5 Creating 'Storage Blob Data Contributor' role assignment under scope '/subscriptions/947382ea-681a-4541-99ab-b718960c6289/resourceGroups/lakeFS' The output includes credentials that you must protect. Be sure that you do not include these credentials in your code or check the credentials into your source control. For more information, see https://aka.ms/azadsp-cli { \"appId\": \"XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\", \"displayName\": \"azure-cli-2023-01-30-06-18-30\", \"password\": \"XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\", \"tenant\": \"XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\" } . The command output should be used to populate the following environment variables: . AZURE_CLIENT_ID = $appId AZURE_TENANT_ID = $tenant AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET = $password . Note: Service Principal credentials have an expiry date and lakeFS will lose access to resources unless credentials are renewed on time. Note: It is possible to provide both account based credentials and environment variables to lakeFS. In that case - lakeFS will use the account credentials for any access to data located in the given account, and will try to use the identity credentials for any data located outside the given account. Storage account credentials can be set directly in the lakeFS configuration using the following parameters: . | blockstore.azure.storage_account | blockstore.azure.storage_access_key | . Limitations . Please note that using this authentication method limits lakeFS to the scope of the given storage account. Specifically, the following operations will not work: . | Import of data from different storage accounts | Copy/Read/Write of data that was imported from a different storage account | Create pre-signed URL for data that was imported from a different storage account | .

Note: It’s preferable to run the binary as a service using systemd or your operating system’s facilities. To support container-based environments, you can configure lakeFS using environment variables. Here is a docker run command to demonstrate starting lakeFS using Docker: . docker run \\ --name lakefs \\ -p 8000:8000 \\ -e LAKEFS_DATABASE_TYPE=\"postgres\" \\ -e LAKEFS_DATABASE_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=\"[DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING]\" \\ -e LAKEFS_AUTH_ENCRYPT_SECRET_KEY=\"[ENCRYPTION_SECRET_KEY]\" \\ -e LAKEFS_BLOCKSTORE_TYPE=\"azure\" \\ -e LAKEFS_BLOCKSTORE_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=\"[YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT]\" \\ -e LAKEFS_BLOCKSTORE_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=\"[YOUR_ACCESS_KEY]\" \\ treeverse/lakefs:latest run . See the reference for a complete list of environment variables. You can install lakeFS on Kubernetes using a Helm chart. To install lakeFS with Helm: . | Copy the Helm values file relevant for Azure Blob: . secrets: # replace this with the connection string of the database you created in a previous step: databaseConnectionString: [DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING] # replace this with a randomly-generated string authEncryptSecretKey: [ENCRYPTION_SECRET_KEY] lakefsConfig: | blockstore: type: azure azure: # If you chose to authenticate via access key, unmark the following rows and insert the values from the previous step # storage_account: [your storage account] # storage_access_key: [your access key] . | Fill in the missing values and save the file as conf-values.yaml. For more configuration options, see our Helm chart README. The lakefsConfig parameter is the lakeFS configuration documented here but without sensitive information. Sensitive information like databaseConnectionString is given through separate parameters, and the chart will inject it into Kubernetes secrets. | In the directory where you created conf-values.yaml, run the following commands: . # Add the lakeFS repository helm repo add lakefs https://charts.lakefs.io # Deploy lakeFS helm install my-lakefs lakefs/lakefs -f conf-values.yaml . my-lakefs is the Helm Release name. | . Load balancing . To configure a load balancer to direct requests to the lakeFS servers you can use the LoadBalancer Service type or a Kubernetes Ingress. By default, lakeFS operates on port 8000 and exposes a /_health endpoint that you can use for health checks. 💡 The NGINX Ingress Controller by default limits the client body size to 1 MiB. Some clients use bigger chunks to upload objects - for example, multipart upload to lakeFS using the S3-compatible Gateway or a simple PUT request using the OpenAPI Server.

After creating a lakeFS repository, configure tables as table descriptor objects on the repository on the path _lakefs_tables/TABLE.yaml. Note: the Glue exporter can currently only export tables of type: hive. We expect to add more. Hive tables . Hive metadata server tables are essentially just a set of objects that share a prefix, with no table metadata stored on the object store. You need to configure prefix, partitions, and schema. name: animals type: hive path: path/to/animals/ partition_columns: ['year'] schema: type: struct fields: - name: year type: integer nullable: false metadata: {} - name: page type: string nullable: false metadata: {} - name: site type: string nullable: true metadata: comment: a comment about this column . Useful types recognized by Hive include integer, long, short, string, double, float, date, and timestamp. Catalog Exporters . Exporters are code packages accessible through Lua integration.

Tip: Actions can be extended to customize any desired behavior, for example validating branch names since they are part of the table name: . # _lakefs_actions/validate_branch_name.yaml name: validate-lower-case-branches on: pre-create-branch: hooks: - id: check_branch_id type: lua properties: script: | regexp = require(\"regexp\") if not regexp.match(\"^[a-z0-9\\\\_\\\\-]+$\", action.branch_id) then error(\"branches must be lower case, invalid branch ID: \" .. action.branch_id) end .

    "content": "Every day we introduce new data to the lake. And even if the code and infra doesn’t change, the data might, and those changes introduce potential quality issues. This is one of the complexities of a data product; the data we consume changes over the course of a month, a week, day, hour, or even minute-to-minute. Examples of changes to data that may occur: . | A client-side bug in the data collection of website events | A new Android version that interferes with the collecting events from your App | COVID-19 abrupt impact on consumers’ behavior, and its effect on the accuracy of ML models. | During a change to Salesforce interface, the validation requirement from a certain field had been lost | . lakeFS enable CI/CD-inspired workflows to help validate expectations and assumptions about the data before it goes live in production or lands in the data environment. Example 1: Data update safety . Continuous deployment of existing data we expect to consume, flowing from ingest-pipelines into the lake. We merge data from an ingest branch (“events-data”), which allows us to create tests using data analysis tools or data quality services (e.g. Great Expectations, Monte Carlo) to ensure reliability of the data we merge to the main branch. Since merge is atomic, no performance issue will be introduced by using lakeFS, but your main branch will only include quality data. Each merge to the main branch creates a new commit on the main branch, which serves as a new version of the data. This allows us to easily revert to previous states of the data if a newer change introduces data issues. Example 2: Test - Validate new data . Examples of common validation checks enforced in organizations: . | No user_* columns except under /private/… | Only (*.parquet | *.orc | _delta_log/*.json) files allowed | Under /production, only backward-compatible schema changes are allowed | New tables on main must be registered in our metadata repository first, with owner and SLA | . lakeFS will assist in enforcing best practices by giving you a designated branch to ingest new data (“new-data-1” in the drawing). You may run automated tests to validate predefined best practices as pre-merge hooks. If the validation passes, the new data will be automatically and atomically merged to the main branch. However, if the validation fails, you will be alerted and the new data will not be exposed to consumers. By using this branching model and implementing best practices as pre merge hooks, you ensure the main lake is never compromised. ",

As more and more organizations rely on data to enable business critical decisions, data reliability and trust are of paramount concern. Thus, it’s important to ensure that production data adheres to the data governance policies of businesses. These data governance requirements can be as simple as a file format validation, schema check, or an exhaustive PII(Personally Identifiable Information) data removal from all of organization’s data. Thus, to ensure the quality and reliability at each stage of the data lifecycle, data quality gates need to be implemented. That is, we need to run Continuous Integration(CI) tests on the data, and only if data governance requirements are met can the data can be promoted to production for business use. Everytime there is an update to production data, the best practice would be to run CI tests and then promote(deploy) the data to production. ",

    "content": "lakeFS makes implementing CI/CD pipelines for data simpler. lakeFS provides a feature called hooks that allow automation of checks and validations of data on lakeFS branches. These checks can be triggered by certain data operations like committing, merging, etc. Functionally, lakeFS hooks are similar to Git Hooks. lakeFS hooks are run remotely on a server, and they are guaranteed to run when the appropriate event is triggered. Here are some examples of the hooks lakeFS supports: . | pre-merge | pre-commit | post-merge | post-commit | pre-create-branch | post-create-branch | . and so on. By leveraging the pre-commit and pre-merge hooks with lakeFS, you can implement CI/CD pipelines on your data lakes. Specific trigger rules, quality checks and the branch on which the rules are to be applied are declared in actions.yaml file. When a specific event (say, pre-merge) occurs, lakeFS runs all the validations declared in actions.yaml file. If validations error out, the merge event is blocked. Here is a sample actions.yaml file that has pre-merge hook configured to allow only parquet and delta lake file formats on main branch. name: ParquetOnlyInProduction description: This webhook ensures that only parquet files are written under production/ on: pre-merge: branches: - main hooks: - id: production_format_validator type: webhook description: Validate file formats properties: url: \"http://lakefs-hooks:5001/webhooks/format\" query_params: allow: [\"parquet\", \"delta_lake\"] prefix: analytics/ .

    "content": "Version 1.0.0 promises API and SDK stability. By “API” we mean any access to a lakeFS REST endpoint. By “SDK” we mean auto-generated lakeFS clients: lakefs-sdk for Python and io.lakefs:sdk for Java. This guide details the steps to allow you to upgrade your code to enjoy this stability. Avoid using APIs and SDKs labeled as experimental, internal, or deprecated. If you must use them, be prepared to adjust your application to align with any lakeFS server updates. Your software developed without such APIs should be compatible with all minor version updates of the lakeFS server from the version you originally developed with. If you rely on a publicly released API and SDK, it will adhere to semantic versioning. Transitioning your application to a minor SDK version update should be smooth. The operation names and tags from the api/swagger.yml specification might differ based on the SDK or coding language in use. Deleted API Operations . The following API operations have been removed: . | updatePassword | forgotPassword | logBranchCommits | expandTemplate | createMetaRange | ingestRange | updateBranchToken | . Internal API Operations . The following operations are for internal use only and should not be used in your application code. Some deprecated operations have alternatives provided. | setupCommPrefs | getSetupState | setup | getAuthCapabilities | uploadObjectPreflight | setGarbageCollectionRulesPreflight | createBranchProtectionRulePreflight | postStatsEvents | dumpRefs (will be replaced with a long-running API later) | restoreRefs (will be replaced with a long-running API later) | createSymlinkFile (Deprecated) | getStorageConfig (Deprecated.

    "content": "Introduction . If you are using the lakeFS client for Java or for any other JVM-based language, be aware that the current package is not stable with respect to minor version upgrades. Transitioning from io.lakefs:lakefs-client to io.lakefs:sdk will necessitate rewriting your API calls to fit the new design paradigm. Problem with the Old Style . Previously, API calls required developers to pass all parameters, including optional ones, in a single function call. As demonstrated in this older style: . ObjectStats objectStat = objectsApi.statObject( objectLoc.getRepository(), objectLoc.getRef(), objectLoc.getPath(), false, false); . This method posed a couple of challenges: . | Inflexibility with Upgrades: If an optional parameter were introduced in newer versions, existing code would fail to compile. | Maintenance Difficulty: Long argument lists can be challenging to manage and understand, leading to potential mistakes and readability issues. | . Adopting the Fluent Style . In the revised SDK, API calls adopt a fluent style, making the code more modular and adaptive to changes. Here’s an example of the new style: . ObjectStats objectStat = objectsApi .statObject( objectLoc.getRepository(), objectLoc.getRef(), objectLoc.getPath() ) .userMetadata(true) .execute(); . Here’s a breakdown of the changes: . | Initial Function Call: Begin by invoking the desired function with all required parameters. | Modifying Optional Parameters: Chain any modifications to optional parameters after the initial function. For instance, userMetadata is changed in the example above. | Unused Optional Parameters: You can safely ignore these. For instance, this code ignores the presign optional parameter because it never uses it. | Execution: Complete the call with the .execute() method. | . This new design offers several advantages: . | Compatibility with Upgrades: When a new optional parameter is introduced, existing code will use its default value, preserving compatibility with minor server version upgrades. | Improved Readability: The fluent style makes it evident which parameters are required and which ones are optional, enhancing code clarity. | . When migrating your code, ensure you refactor all your API calls to adopt the new fluent style. This ensures that your application remains maintainable and is safeguarded against potential issues arising from minor SDK version upgrades. For an illustrative example of the transition between styles, you can view the changes made in this pull request: lakeFS pull request #6529. ",

    "content": "Introduction . If you are using the lakeFS client for Python, be aware that the current package is not stable with respect to minor version upgrades. Transitioning from lakefs-client to lakefs-sdk will necessitate rewriting your API calls. Here’s a breakdown of the changes: . | Modules change . | The previous model module was renamed to models, meaning that lakefs_client.model imports should be replaced with lakefs_sdk.models imports. | The apis module in lakefs_client is deprecated and no longer supported. To migrate to the new api module in lakefs_sdk, you should replace all imports of lakefs_client.apis with imports of lakefs_sdk.api. We still recommend using the lakefs_sdk.LakeFSClient class instead of using the api module directly. The LakeFSClient class provides a higher-level interface to the LakeFS API and makes it easier to use LakeFS in your applications. | . | upload_object API call: The content parameter value passed to the objects_api.upload_object method call should be either a string containing the path to the uploaded file, or bytes of data to be uploaded. | get_object API call: The return value of client.get_object(...) is a bytearray containing the content of the object. | **client.{operation}_api**: The lakefs-client package’s LakeFSClient class’s deprecation-marked operations (client.{operation}) will no longer be available in the lakefs-sdk package’s LakeFSClient class. In their place, the client.{operation}_api should be used. | Minimum Python Version: 3.7 | Fetching results from response objects: Instead of fetching the required results properties from a dictionary using response_result.get_property(prop_name), the response objects will include domain specific entities, thus referring to the properties in the results of the response - response_result.prop_name. For example, instead of: | . response = lakefs_client.branches.diff_branch(repository='repo', branch='main') diff = response.results[0] # 'results' is a 'DiffList' object path = diff.get_property('path') # 'diff' is a dictionary .

    "content": "As part of our routine work with data we develop new code, improve and upgrade old code, upgrade infrastructures, and test new technologies. lakeFS enables a safe test environment on your data lake without the need to copy or mock data, work on the pipelines or involve DevOps. Creating a branch provides you an isolated environment with a snapshot of your repository (any part of your data lake you chose to manage on lakeFS). While working on your own branch in isolation, all other data users will be looking at the repository’s main branch. They can’t see your changes, and you don’t see changes to main done after you created the branch. No worries, no data duplication is done, it’s all metadata management behind the scenes. Let’s look at 2 examples of a test environment and their branching models. Example 1: Upgrading Spark and using Reset action . You installed the latest version of Apache Spark. As a first step you’ll test your Spark jobs to see that the upgrade doesn’t have any undesired side effects. For this purpose, you may create a branch (testing-spark-3.0) which will only be used to test the Spark upgrade, and discarded later. Jobs may run smoothly (the theoretical possibility exists!), or they may fail halfway through, leaving you with some intermediate partitions, data and metadata. In this case, you can simply reset the branch to its original state, without worrying about the intermediate results of your last experiment, and perform another (hopefully successful) test in an isolated branch. Reset actions are atomic and immediate, so no manual cleanup is required. Once testing is completed, and you have achieved the desired result, you can delete this experimental branch, and all data not used on any other branch will be deleted with it. Creating a testing branch: . lakectl branch create \\ lakefs://example-repo/testing-spark-3 \\ --source lakefs://example-repo/main # output: # created branch 'testing-spark-3' . Resetting changes to a branch: . lakectl branch reset lakefs://example-repo/testing-spark-3 # are you sure you want to reset all uncommitted changes?: y█ . Note lakeFS version &lt;= v0.33.1 uses ‘@’ (instead of ‘/’) as separator between repository and branch. Example 2: Collaborate &amp; Compare - Which option is better? . Easily compare by testing which one performs better on your data set. Examples may be: . | Different computation tools, e.g Spark vs. Presto | Different compression algorithms | Different Spark configurations | Different code versions of an ETL | . Run each experiment on its own independent branch, while the main remains untouched. Once both experiments are done, create a comparison query (using Hive or Presto or any other tool of your choice) to compare data characteristics, performance or any other metric you see fit. With lakeFS you don’t need to worry about creating data paths for the experiments, copying data, and remembering to delete it. It’s substantially easier to avoid errors and maintain a clean lake after. Reading from and comparing branches using Spark: . val dfExperiment1 = sc.read.parquet(\"s3a://example-repo/experiment-1/events/by-date\") val dfExperiment2 = sc.read.parquet(\"s3a://example-repo/experiment-2/events/by-date\") dfExperiment1.groupBy(\"...\").count() dfExperiment2.groupBy(\"...\").count() // now we can compare the properties of the data itself .

Installing the Delta Lake diff plugin . To enable the Delta Lake diff feature, you need to install a plugin on the lakeFS server. You will find the plugin binary in the release tarball (versions &gt;= 0.97.3). Rename the delta_diff binary to delta and put it under ~/.lakefs/plugins/diff on the machine where lakeFS is running. You can customize the location of the Delta Lake diff plugin by changing the diff.delta.plugin and plugin.properties.&lt;plugin name&gt;.path configurations in the .lakefs.yaml file. Notice: If you’re using the lakeFS docker image, the plugin is installed by default. ",

This is because the Delta log is an auto-generated sequence of text files used to keep track of transactions on a Delta table sequentially. Writing to one Delta table from multiple lakeFS branches is possible, but note that it would result in conflicts if later attempting to merge one branch into the other. When running lakeFS inside your VPC (on AWS) . When lakeFS runs inside your private network, your Databricks cluster needs to be able to access it. This can be done by setting up a VPC peering between the two VPCs (the one where lakeFS runs and the one where Databricks runs). For this to work on Delta Lake tables, you would also have to disable multi-cluster writes with: . spark.databricks.delta.multiClusterWrites.enabled false . Using multi cluster writes (on AWS) . When using multi-cluster writes, Databricks overrides Delta’s S3-commit action. The new action tries to contact lakeFS from servers on Databricks’ own AWS account, which of course won’t be able to access your private network. So, if you must use multi-cluster writes, you’ll have to allow access from Databricks’ AWS account to lakeFS. If you are trying to achieve that, please reach out on Slack and the community will try to assist. ",

Running ETL and transformation jobs directly in production without proper ETL testing presents a huge risk of having data issues flow into dashboards, ML models, and other consumers sooner or later. The most common approach to avoid making changes directly in production is to create and maintain multiple data environments and perform ETL testing on them. Dev environments give you a space in which to develop the data pipelines and test environment where pipeline changes are tested before pushing it to production. Without lakeFS, the challenge with this approach is that it can be time-consuming and costly to maintain these separate dev/test environments to enable thorough effective ETL testing. And for larger teams it forces multiple people to share these environments, requiring significant coordination. Depending on the size of the data involved there can also be high costs due to the duplication of data. ",

You can think of each branch in lakeFS as its own environment. This is because branches are isolated, meaning changes on one branch have no effect other branches. Objects that remain unchanged between two branches are not copied, but rather shared to both branches via metadata pointers that lakeFS manages. If you make a change on one branch and want it reflected on another, you can perform a merge operation to update one branch with the changes from another. ",

Let us explore how to create dev/test environments using each of these options below. There are two ways that you can try out lakeFS: . | The lakeFS Playground on lakeFS Cloud - fully managed lakeFS with a 30-day free trial | Local Docker-based quickstart and samples | . You can also deploy lakeFS locally or self-managed on your cloud of choice. Using lakeFS Playground on lakeFS Cloud . In this tutorial, we will use a lakeFS playground environment to create dev/test data environments for ETL testing. This allows you to spin up a lakeFS instance in a click, create different data environments by simply branching out of your data repository and develop &amp; test data pipelines in these isolated branches. First, let us spin up a playground instance. Once you have a live environment, login to your instance with access and secret keys. Then, you can work with the sample data repository my-repo that is created for you. Click on my-repo and notice that by default, the repo has a main branch created and sample_data preloaded to work with. You can create a new branch (say, test-env) by going to the Branches tab and clicking Create Branch. Once it is successful, you will see two branches under the repo: main and test-env. Now you can add, modify or delete objects under the test-env branch without affecting the data in the main branch. Trying out lakeFS with Docker and Jupyter Notebooks . This use case shows how to create dev/test data environments for ETL testing using lakeFS branches. The following tutorial provides a lakeFS environment, a Jupyter notebook, and Python lakefs_client API to demonstrate integration of lakeFS with Spark. You can run this tutorial on your local machine. Follow the tutorial video below to get started with the playground and Jupyter notebook, or follow the instructions on this page. Prerequisites . Before getting started, you will need Docker installed on your machine. Running lakeFS and Jupyter Notebooks . Follow along the steps below to create dev/test environment with lakeFS. | Start by cloning the lakeFS samples Git repository: . git clone https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS-samples.git . cd lakeFS-samples . | Run following commands to download and run Docker container which includes Python, Spark, Jupyter Notebook, JDK, Hadoop binaries, lakeFS Python client and Airflow (Docker image size is around 4.5GB): . git submodule init git submodule update docker compose up . | . Open the local Jupyter Notebook and go to the spark-demo.ipynb notebook. Configuring lakeFS Python Client . Setup lakeFS access credentials for the lakeFS instance running. The defaults for these that the samples repo Docker Compose uses are shown here: . lakefsAccessKey = 'AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE' lakefsSecretKey = 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY' lakefsEndPoint = 'http://lakefs:8000' . Next, setup the storage namespace to a location in the bucket you have configured. The storage namespace is a location in the underlying storage where data for this repository will be stored. storageNamespace = 's3://example/' . You can use lakeFS through the UI, API or lakectl commandline. For this use-case, we use python lakefs_client to run lakeFS core operations. import lakefs_client from lakefs_client import models from lakefs_client.client import LakeFSClient # lakeFS credentials and endpoint configuration = lakefs_client.Configuration() configuration.username = lakefsAccessKey configuration.password = lakefsSecretKey configuration.host = lakefsEndPoint client = LakeFSClient(configuration) . lakeFS can be configured to work with Spark in two ways: . | Access lakeFS using the S3-compatible API | Access lakeFS using the lakeFS-specific Hadoop FileSystem | . Upload the Sample Data to Main Branch . To upload an object to the my-repo, use the following command. import os contentToUpload = open('/data/lakefs_test.csv', 'rb') client.objects.upload_object( repository=\"my-repo\", branch=\"main\", path=fileName, content=contentToUpload) . Once uploaded, commit the changes to the main branch and attach some metadata to the commit as well. client.commits.commit( repository=\"my-repo\", branch=\"main\", commit_creation=models.CommitCreation( message='Added my first object!', metadata={'using': 'python_api'})) . In this example, we use lakeFS S3A gateway to read data from the storage bucket. dataPath = f\"s3a://my-repo/main/lakefs_test.csv\" df = spark.read.csv(dataPath) df.show() . Create a Test Branch . Let us start by creating a new branch test-env on the example repo my-repo. client.branches.create_branch( repository=\"my-repo\", branch_creation=models.BranchCreation( name=\"test-env\", source=\"main\")) . Now we can use Spark to write the csv file from main branch as a Parquet file to the test-env of our lakeFS repo. Suppose we accidentally write the dataframe back to “test-env” branch again, this time in append mode. df.write.mode('overwrite').parquet('s3a://my-repo/test-env/') df.write.mode('append').parquet('s3a://my-repo/test-env/') . What happens if we re-read in the data on both branches and perform a count on the resulting DataFrames? There will be twice as many rows in test-env branch. That is, we accidentally duplicated our data! Oh no! . Data duplication introduce errors into our data analytics, BI and machine learning efforts; hence we would like to avoid duplicating our data. On the main branch however, there is still just the original data - untouched by our Spark code. This shows the utility of branch-based isolated environments with lakeFS. You can safely continue working with the data from main which is unharmed due to lakeFS isolation capabilities. ",

    "title": "lakeFS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)",
    "content": "1. Is lakeFS open-source? . lakeFS is completely free, open-source, and licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. We maintain a public product roadmap and a Slack channel for open discussions. 2. How does lakeFS data versioning work? . lakeFS uses zero-copy branching to avoid data duplication. That is, creating a new branch is a metadata-only operation: no objects are actually copied. Only when an object changes does lakeFS create another version of the data in the storage. For more information, see Versioning internals. 3. How do I get support for my lakeFS installation? . We are extremely responsive on our Slack channel, and we make sure to prioritize the most pressing issues for the community. For SLA-based support, please contact us at support@treeverse.io. 4. Do you collect data from your active installations? . We collect anonymous usage statistics to understand the patterns of use and to detect product gaps we may have so we can fix them. This is optional and may be turned off by setting stats.enabled to false. See the configuration reference for more details. The data we gather is limited to the following: . | A UUID which is generated when setting up lakeFS for the first time and contains no personal or otherwise identifiable information, | The lakeFS version currently running, | The OS and architecture lakeFS is running on, | Metadata regarding the database used (version, installed extensions and parameters such as DB Timezone and work memory), | Periodic aggregated action counters (e.g. how many “get_object” operations occurred). | . 5. How is lakeFS different from Delta Lake / Hudi / Iceberg? . Delta Lake, Apache Hudi, and Apache Iceberg all define dedicated, structured data formats that allow deletes and upserts. lakeFS is format-agnostic and enables consistent cross-collection versioning of your data using Git-like operations. Read our comparison for a more detailed comparison. 6. What inspired the lakeFS logo? . The Axolotl – a species of salamander, also known as the Mexican Lake Monster or the Peter Pan of the animal kingdom. It’s a magical creature, living in a lake - just like us! :) . copyright . ",

This allows you to travel back in time to previous versions of your data. However, sometimes you may want to remove the objects from the underlying storage completely. Reasons for this include cost-reduction and privacy policies. The garbage collection (GC) job is a Spark program that removes the following from the underlying storage: . | Committed objects that have been deleted (or replaced) in lakeFS, and are considered expired according to rules you define. | Uncommitted objects that are no longer accessible . | For example, objects deleted before ever being committed. | . | .

Garbage collection rules determine for how long an object is kept in the storage after it is deleted (or replaced) in lakeFS. For every branch, the GC job retains deleted objects for the number of days defined for the branch. In the absence of a branch-specific rule, the default rule for the repository is used. If an object is present in more than one branch ancestry, it is removed only after the retention period has ended for all relevant branches. Example GC rules for a repository: . { \"default_retention_days\": 14, \"branches\": [ {\"branch_id\": \"main\", \"retention_days\": 21}, {\"branch_id\": \"dev\", \"retention_days\": 7} ] } . In the above example, objects will be retained for 14 days after deletion by default. However, if present in the branch main, objects will be retained for 21 days. Objects present only in the dev branch will be retained for 7 days after they are deleted. How to configure garbage collection rules . To define retention rules, either use the lakectl command, the lakeFS web UI, or API: . | CLI | Web UI | .

    "doc": "Glue / Hive metastore",
    "title": "Managing Tables With lakeFS Branches",
    "content": "Motivation . When creating a table in Glue/Hive metastore (using a client such as Spark, Hive, Presto), we specify the table location. Consider the table my_table that was created with the location s3://example/main/path/to/table. Suppose you created a new branch called DEV with main as the source branch. The data from s3://example/main/path/to/table is now accessible in s3://example/DEV/path/to/table. The metadata is not managed in lakeFS, meaning you don’t have any table pointing to s3://example/DEV/path/to/table. To address this, lakeFS introduces lakectl metastore commands. The case above can be handled using the copy command: it creates a copy of my_table with data located in s3://example/DEV/path/to/table. Note that this is a fast, metadata-only operation. Configurations . The lakectl metastore commands can run on Glue or Hive metastore. Add the following to the lakectl configuration file (by default ~/.lakectl.yaml): . Hive . metastore: type: hive hive: uri: hive-metastore:9083 . Glue . metastore: type: glue glue: catalog_id: 123456789012 region: us-east-1 profile: default # optional, implies using a credentials file credentials: access_key_id: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE secret_access_key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY . Note: It’s recommended to set type and catalog-id/metastore-uri in the lakectl configuration file. Suggested Model . For simplicity, we recommend creating a schema for each branch. That way, you can use the same table name across different schemas. For example: after creating branch example_branch, also create a schema named example_branch. For a table named my_table under the schema main, create a new table under the same name and under the schema example_branch. You now have two my_table, one in the main schema and one in the branch schema. Commands . Metastore tools support three commands: copy, diff, and create-symlink. copy and diff can work both on Glue and on Hive. create-symlink works only on Glue. Note: If to-schema or to-table are not specified, the destination branch and source table names will be used as per the suggested model. Note: Metastore commands can only run on tables located in lakeFS. You should not use tables that aren’t located in lakeFS. Copy . The copy command creates a copy of a table pointing to the defined branch. In case the destination table already exists, the command will only merge the changes. Example: . Suppose we created the table inventory on branch main on schema default. CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE `inventory`( `inv_item_sk` int, `inv_warehouse_sk` int, `inv_quantity_on_hand` int) PARTITIONED BY ( `inv_date_sk` int) STORED AS ORC LOCATION 's3a://my_repo/main/path/to/table'; . We create a new lakeFS branch example_branch: . lakectl branch create lakefs://my_repo/example_branch --source lakefs://my_repo/main . The data from s3://my_repo/main/path/to/table is now accessible in s3://my_repo/DEV/path/to/table. To query the data in s3://my_repo/DEV/path/to/table, you would like to create a copy of the table inventory in schema example_branch pointing to the new branch. lakectl metastore copy --from-schema default --from-table inventory --to-schema example_branch --to-table inventory --to-branch example_branch . After running this command, query the table example_branch.inventory to get the data from s3://my_repo/DEV/path/to/table . Copy Partition . After adding a partition to the branch table, you may want to copy the partition to the main table. For example, for the new partition 2020-08-01, run the following to copy the partition to the main table: . lakectl metastore copy --type hive --from-schema example_branch --from-table inventory --to-schema default --to-table inventory --to-branch main -p 2020-08-01 . For a table partitioned by more than one column, specify the partition flag for every column. For example, for the partition (year='2020',month='08',day='01'): . lakectl metastore copy --from-schema example_branch --from-table branch_inventory --to-schema default --to-branch main -p 2020 -p 08 -p 01 . Diff . Provides a two-way diff between two tables. Shows added+ , removed- and changed~ partitions and columns. Example: . Suppose you made some changes on the copied table inventory on schema example_branch and now want to view the changes before merging back to inventory on schema default. Hive: . lakectl metastore diff --type hive --address thrift://hive-metastore:9083 --from-schema example_branch --from-table branch --to-schema default --to-table inventory . The output will look like this: . Columns are identical Partitions - 2020-07-04 + 2020-07-05 + 2020-07-06 ~ 2020-07-08 . ",

This example uses CSV files, and the files added to lakeFS should look like this: . The exporter script . Upload the following script to your main branch under scripts/animals_exporter.lua (or a path of your choice). For code references check symlink_exporter and glue_exporter docs. local aws = require(\"aws\") local symlink_exporter = require(\"lakefs/catalogexport/symlink_exporter\") local glue_exporter = require(\"lakefs/catalogexport/glue_exporter\") -- settings local access_key = args.aws.aws_access_key_id local secret_key = args.aws.aws_secret_access_key local region = args.aws.aws_region local table_path = args.table_source -- table descriptor local db = args.catalog.db_name -- glue db local table_input = args.catalog.table_input -- table input (AWS input spec) for Glue -- export symlinks local s3 = aws.s3_client(access_key, secret_key, region) local result = symlink_exporter.export_s3(s3, table_path, action, {debug=true}) -- register glue table local glue = aws.glue_client(access_key, secret_key, region) local res = glue_exporter.export_glue(glue, db, table_path, table_input, action, {debug=true}) . Configure Action Hooks . Hooks serve as the mechanism that triggers the execution of the exporter. For more detailed information on how to configure exporter hooks, you can refer to Running an Exporter. The args.catalog.table_input argument in the Lua script is assumed to be passed from the action arguments, that way the same script can be reused for different tables. Check the example to construct the table input in the lua code. | Hook CSV Glue Table | Hook Parquet Glue Table | Multiple Hooks / Inline script | . Single hook with CSV Table .

Multiple Hooks / Inline script . The following example demonstrates how to separate the symlink and glue exporter into building blocks running in separate hooks. It also shows how to run the lua script inline instead of a file, depending on user preference. name: Animal Table Exporter on: post-commit: branches: [\"main\"] hooks: - id: symlink_exporter type: lua properties: args: aws: aws_access_key_id: \"&lt;AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID&gt;\" aws_secret_access_key: \"&lt;AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY&gt;\" aws_region: \"&lt;AWS_REGION&gt;\" table_source: '_lakefs_tables/animals.yaml' script: | local exporter = require(\"lakefs/catalogexport/symlink_exporter\") local aws = require(\"aws\") local table_path = args.table_source local s3 = aws.s3_client(args.aws.aws_access_key_id, args.aws.aws_secret_access_key, args.aws.aws_region) exporter.export_s3(s3, table_path, action, {debug=true}) - id: glue_exporter type: lua properties: args: aws: aws_access_key_id: \"&lt;AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID&gt;\" aws_secret_access_key: \"&lt;AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY&gt;\" aws_region: \"&lt;AWS_REGION&gt;\" table_source: '_lakefs_tables/animals.yaml' catalog: db_name: \"my-glue-db\" table_input: # add glue table input here script: | local aws = require(\"aws\") local exporter = require(\"lakefs/catalogexport/glue_exporter\") local glue = aws.glue_client(args.aws.aws_access_key_id, args.aws.aws_secret_access_key, args.aws.aws_region) exporter.export_glue(glue, args.catalog.db_name, args.table_source, args.catalog.table_input, action, {debug=true}) . Adding the script and the action files to the repository and commit it. This is a post-commit action, meaning it will be executed after the commit operation has taken place. lakectl fs upload lakefs://catalogs/main/scripts/animals_exporter.lua -s ./animals_exporter.lua lakectl fs upload lakefs://catalogs/main/_lakefs_actions/animals_glue.yaml -s ./animals_glue.yaml lakectl commit lakefs://catalogs/main -m \"trigger first export hook\" . Once the action has completed its execution, you can review the results in the action logs. Use Athena . We can use the exported Glue table with any tool that supports Glue Catalog (or Hive compatible) such as Athena, Trino, Spark and others. To use Athena we can simply run MSCK REPAIR TABLE and then query the tables. In Athena, make sure that the correct database (my-glue-db in the example above) is configured, then run: . MSCK REPAIR TABLE `animals_catalogs_main_9255e5`; -- load partitions for the first time SELECT * FROM `animals_catalogs_main_9255e5` limit 50; . Cleanup . Users can use additional hooks / actions to implement a custom cleanup logic to delete the symlink in S3 and Glue Tables. glue.delete_table(db, '&lt;glue table name&gt;') s3.delete_recursive('bucket', 'path/to/symlinks/of/a/commit/') .

This is useful for avoiding accidental PII exposure. | Integration with external systems: Post-merge and post-commit hooks could be used to export metadata about the change to another system.

We believe collaborative communities have the power to bring the best solutions to the community. We believe that every engineer should be able to use, contribute to, and influence cutting edge technologies, so they can innovate in their domain. What is our commitment to open source? . We created lakeFS, our open-source project, to provide a Git-like interface on top of object stores - so that you can fully take advantage of with any data application at any scale. For that reason, we commit that the following capabilities are and will remain open-source as part of lakeFS: . | All versioning capabilities, | Git-Like interface for the versioning operations, | Support for public object store APIs, | Integrations with publicly available applications accessing an object store, | CLI, API, and GUI interfaces. | . We also commit to keeping lakeFS scalable in throughput and performance. We are deeply committed to our community of engineers who use and contribute to the project. We are and will continue to be highly responsive and shape lakeFS together to provide the data versioning capabilities we are all looking for. What is lakeFS Cloud? . Treeverse offers lakeFS Cloud, which provides all the same benefits of the Git-like interface on top of object stores as a fully-managed service. The vision behind lakeFS Cloud is to provide a managed data versioning and management solution for data practitioners. lakeFS Cloud will leverage the lakeFS open-source technology, integrate capabilities and unique features, and lead its users to implement best practices. As part of our commitment to the open source values of transparency and interoperability, we believe everyone should be able to enjoy these benefits, regardless of whether or not they choose to use the managed offering.

    "content": "lakeFS is an open source project that supports managing data in AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and any other object storage with an S3 interface. It integrates seamlessly with popular data frameworks such as Spark, Hive Metastore, dbt, Trino, Presto, and many others and includes an S3 compatibility layer. For more details and a full list see the integrations pages. lakeFS maintains compatibility with the S3 API to minimize adoption friction. You can use it as a drop-in replacement for S3 from the perspective of any tool interacting with a data lake. For example, take the common operation of reading a collection of data from an object storage into a Spark DataFrame. For data outside a lakeFS repo, the code will look like this: . df = spark.read.parquet(\"s3a://my-bucket/collections/foo/\") . After adding the data collections into my-bucket to a repository, the same operation becomes: . df = spark.read.parquet(\"s3a://my-repo/main-branch/collections/foo/\") . You can use the same methods and syntax you are already using to read and write data when using a lakeFS repository. This simplifies the adoption of lakeFS - minimal changes are needed to get started, making further changes an incremental process. ",

Through its versioning engine, lakeFS enables the following built-in operations familiar from Git: . | branch: a consistent copy of a repository, isolated from other branches and their changes. Initial creation of a branch is a metadata operation that does not duplicate objects. | commit: an immutable checkpoint containing a complete snapshot of a repository. | merge: performed between two branches — merges atomically update one branch with the changes from another. | revert: returns a repo to the exact state of a previous commit. | tag: a pointer to a single immutable commit with a readable, meaningful name. | .

Reproducibility: What Did My Data Look Like at a Point In Time? . Being able to look at data as it was at a given point is particularly useful in at least two scenarios: . | Reproducibility of ML experiments . ML experimentation is usually an iterative process, and being able to reproduce a specific iteration is important. With lakeFS you can version all components of an ML experiment including its data, as well as make use of zero-copy branching to minimise the footprint of versions of the data . | Troubleshooting production problems . Data engineers are often asked to validate the data. A user might report inconsistencies, question the accuracy, or simply report it to be incorrect. Since the data continuously changes, it is challenging to understand its state at the time of the error. With lakeFS you can create a branch from a commit to debug an issue in isolation. | . 👉🏻 Read More . Rollback of Data Changes and Recovery from Data Errors . Human error, misconfiguration, or wide-ranging systematic effects are unavoidable. When they do happen, erroneous data may make it into production or critical data assets might accidentally be deleted. By their nature, backups are a wrong tool for recovering from such events. Backups are periodic events that are usually not tied to performing erroneous operations. So, they may be out of date, and will require sifting through data at the object level. This process is inefficient and can take hours, days, or in some cases, weeks to complete. By quickly committing entire snapshots of data at well-defined times, recovering data in deletion or corruption events becomes an instant one-line operation with lakeFS: just identify a good historical commit, and then restore to it or copy from it. 👉🏻 Read more . Multi-Table Transactions guarantees . Data engineers typically need to implement custom logic in scripts to guarantee two or more data assets are updated synchronously. This logic often requires extensive rewrites or periods during which data is unavailable. The lakeFS merge operation from one branch into another removes the need to implement this logic yourself. Instead, make updates to the desired data assets on a branch and then utilize a lakeFS merge to atomically expose the data to downstream consumers. To learn more about atomic cross-collection updates, check out this video which describes the concept in more detail, along with this notebook in the lakeFS samples repository. Establishing data quality guarantees - CI/CD for data . The best way to deal with mistakes is to avoid them. A data source that is ingested into the lake introducing low-quality data should be blocked before exposure if possible. With lakeFS, you can achieve this by tying data quality tests to commit and merge operations via lakeFS hooks. 👉🏻 Read more . ",

    "content": ". | Optimistic Locking with KV | DB Transactions and Atomic Updates | So, Which Approach is Better? | . Starting at version 0.80.2, lakeFS abandoned the tight coupling to PostgreSQL and moved all database operations to work over Key-Value Store . While SQL databases, and Postgres among them, have their obvious advantages, we felt that the tight coupling to Postgres is limiting our users and so, lakeFS with Key Value Store is introduced. Our KV Store implements a generic interface, with methods for Get, Set, Compare-and-Set, Delete and Scan. Each entry is represented by a [partition, key, value] triplet. All these fields are generic byte-array, and the using module has maximal flexibility on the format to use for each field . Under the hood, our KV implementation relies on a backing DB, which persists the data. Theoretically, it could be any type of database and out of the box, we already implemented drivers for DynamoDB, for AWS users, and PostgreSQL, using its relational nature to store a KV Store. More databases will be supported in the future, and lakeFS users and contributors can develop their own driver to use their own favorite database. For experimenting purposes, an in-memory KV store can be used, though it obviously lack the persistency aspect . In order to store its metadata objects (that is Repositories, Branches, Commits, Tags, and Uncommitted Objects), lakeFS implements another layer over the generic KV Store, which supports serialization and deserialization of these objects as protobuf. As this layer relies on the generic interface of the KV Store layer, it is totally agnostic to whichever store implementation is in use, gaining our users the maximal flexibility .

    "title": "Optimistic Locking with KV",
    "content": "One important key difference between SQL databases and Key Value Store is the ability to lock resources. While this is a common practice with relational databases, Key Value stores not always support this ability. When designing our KV Store, we tried to support the most simplistic straight-forward interface, with flexibility in backing DB selection, and so, we decided not to support locking. This decision brought some concurrency challenges we had to overcome. Let us take a look at a common lakeFS flow, Commit, during which several database operations are performed: . | All relevant (Branch correlated) uncommitted objects are collected and marked as committed | A new Commit object is created | The relevant Branch is updated to point to the new commit | . The Commit flow includes multiple database accesses and modifications, and is very sensitive to concurrent executions: If 2 Commit flows run in parallel, we must guarantee correctness of the data. lakeFS with PostgreSQL simply locks the Branch for the entire Commit operation, preventing concurrent execution of such flows. Now, with KV Store replacing the SQL database, this easy solution is no longer available. Instead, we implemented an Optimistic Locking algorithm, which leverages the KV Store Compare-And-Set (CAS) functionality to remember the Branch state at the beginning of the Commit flow, and updating the branch at the end, only if it remains unchanged, using CAS, with the former Branch state, used as a comparison criteria. If the sampled Branch state and the current state differ, it could only mean that another, later, Commit is in progress, causing the first Commit to fail, and give the later Commit a chance to complete. Here’s a running example: . | Commit A sets the StagingToken to tokenA and samples the Branch, | Commit B sets the StagingToken to tokenB and samples the Branch, | Commit A finishes, tries to update the Branch and fails due to the recent modification by Commit B - the StagingToken is set to tokenB and not tokenA as expected by Commit A, | Commit B finishes and updates the branch, as tokenB is set as StagingToken and it matches the flow expectation | . An important detail to note, is that as a Commit starts, and the StagingToken is set a new value, the former value is added to a list of ‘still valid’ StagingToken_s - _SealedToken - on the Branch, which makes sure no StagingToken and no object are lost due to a failed Commit . You can read more on the Commit Flow in the dedicated section in the KV Design . ",

    "title": "DB Transactions and Atomic Updates",
    "content": "Another notable difference is the existence of DB transactions with PostgreSQL, ability that our KV Store lacks. This ability was leveraged by lakeFS to construct several DB updates, into one “atomic” operation - each failure, in each step, rolled back the entire operation, keeping the DB consistent and clean. With KV Store, this ability is gone, and we had to come up with various solutions. As a starting point, the DB consistency is, obviously, not anything we can risk. On the other hand, maintaining the DB clean, and as a result smaller, is something that can be sacrificed, at least as a first step. Let us take a look at a relatively simple flow of a new Repository creation: A brand new Repository has 3 objects: The Repository object itself, an initial Branch object and an initial Commit, which the Branch points to. With SQL DB, it was as simple as creating all 3 objects in the DB under one transaction (at this order). Any failure resulted in a rollback and no redundant leftovers in our DB. With no transaction in KV Store, if for example the Branch creation fails, it will leave the Repository without an initial Branch (or a Branch at all), yet the Repository will be accessible. Trying to delete the Repository as a response to Branch creation failure is ony a partial solution as this operation can fail as well. To mitigate this we introduced a per-_Repository_-partition, which holds all repository related objects (the Branch and Commit in this scenario). The partition key can only be derived from the specific Repository instance itself. In addition we first create the Repository objects, the Commit and the Branch, under the Repository’s partition key, and then the Repository is created. The Repository and its objects will be accessible only after a successful creation of all 3 entities. A failure in this flow might leave some dangling objects, but consistency is maintained. The number of such dangling objects is not expected to be significant, and we plan to implement a cleaning algorithm to keep our KV Store neat and clean . ",

It discusses the challenges we faced, and the solutions we provided to overcome these challenges. Considering the fact that lakeFS over with relational database did work, you might ask yourself why did we bother to develop another solution. The simple answer, is that while PostgreSQL was not a bad option, it was the only option, and any drawback of PostgreSQL, reflected on our users: . | PostgreSQL can only scale vertically and that is a limitation. At some point this might not hold. | PostgreSQL is not a managed solution, meaning that users had to take care of all maintenance tasks, including the above mentioned scale (when needed) | As an unmanaged database, scaling means downtime - is that acceptable? | It might even get to the point that your organization is not willing to work with PostgreSQL due to various business considerations | . If none of the above apply, and you have no seemingly reason to switch from PostgreSQL, it can definitely still be used as an excellent option for the backing database for the lakeFS KV Store. If you do need another solution, you have DynamoDB support, out of the box. DynamoDB, as a fully managed solution, with horizontal scalability support and optimized partitions support, answers all the pain-points specified above. It is definitely an option to consider, if you need to overcome these And, of course, you can always decide to implement your own KV Store driver to use your database of choice - we would love to add your contribution to lakeFS .

You may omit any of the fields from the table, resulting in a default value of 0 for omitted fields . time/parse(layout, value) . Returns a float64 representing the amount of nanoseconds since the unix epoch (01/01/1970 00:00:00). This timestamp will represent date value parsed using the layout format. The layout parameter should follow Go’s time layout format . time/parse_iso(value) . Returns a float64 representing the amount of nanoseconds since the unix epoch (01/01/1970 00:00:00 for value. The value string should be in ISO8601 format . uuid/new() . Returns a new 128-bit RFC 4122 UUID in string representation. net/url .

Provides a request function that performs an HTTP request. For security reasons, this package is not available by default as it enables http requests to be sent out from the lakeFS instance network. The feature should be enabled under actions.lua.net_http_enabled configuration. Request will time out after 30 seconds. http.request(url [, body]) http.request{ url = string, [method = string,] [headers = header-table,] [body = string,] } . Returns a code (number), body (string), headers (table) and status (string). | code - status code number | body - string with the response body | headers - table with the response request headers (key/value or table of values) | status - status code text | . The first form of the call will perform GET requests or POST requests if the body parameter is passed. The second form accepts a table and allows you to customize the request method and headers. Example of a GET request . local http = require(\"net/http\") local code, body = http.request(\"https://example.com\") if code == 200 then print(body) else print(\"Failed to get example.com - status code: \" .. code) end . Example of a POST request . local http = require(\"net/http\") local code, body = http.request{ url=\"https://httpbin.org/post\", method=\"POST\", body=\"custname=tester\", headers={[\"Content-Type\"]=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"}, } if code == 200 then print(body) else print(\"Failed to post data - status code: \" .. code) end .

    "title": "Version Control",
    "content": "lakeFS is spearheading version control semantics for data. Most of these concepts will be familiar to Git users: . Repository . In lakeFS, a repository is a set of related objects (or collections of objects). In many cases, these represent tables of various formats for tabular data, semi-structured data such as JSON or log files - or a set of unstructured objects such as images, videos, sensor data, etc. lakeFS represents repositories as a logical namespace used to group together objects, branches, and commits - analogous to a repository in Git. lakeFS repository naming requirements are as follows: . | Start with a lower case letter or number | Contain only lower case letters, numbers and hyphens | Be between 3 and 63 characters long | . Commits . Using commits, you can view a repository at a certain point in its history and you’re guaranteed that the data you see is exactly as it was at the point of committing it. These commits are immutable “checkpoints” containing all contents of a repository at a given point in the repository’s history. Each commit contains metadata - the committer, timestamp, a commit message, as well as arbitrary key/value pairs you can choose to add. Identifying Commits A commit is identified by its commit ID, a digest of all contents of the commit. Commit IDs are by nature long, so you may use a unique prefix to abbreviate them. A commit may also be identified by using a textual definition, called a ref. Examples of refs include tags, branch names, and expressions. Branches . Branches in lakeFS allow users to create their own “isolated” view of the repository. Changes on one branch do not appear on other branches. Users can take changes from one branch and apply it to another by merging them. Zero-copy branching . Under the hood, branches are simply a pointer to a commit along with a set of uncommitted changes. Creating a branch is a zero-copy operation; instead of duplicating data, it involves creating a pointer to the source commit for the branch. Tags . Tags are a way to give a meaningful name to a specific commit. Using tags allow users to reference specific releases, experiments, or versions by using a human friendly name. Example tags: . | v2.3 to mark a release. | dev-jane-before-v2.3-merge to mark Jane’s private temporary point. | . Tag names adhere to the same rules as git ref names. History . The history of the branch is the list of commits from the branch tip through the first parent of each commit. Histories go back in time. Merge . Merging is the way to integrate changes from a branch into another branch. The result of a merge is a new commit, with the destination as the first parent and the source as the second. To learn more about how merging works in lakeFS, see the merge reference . Ref expressions . lakeFS also supports expressions for creating a ref. These are similar to revisions in Git; indeed all ~ and ^ examples at the end of that section will work unchanged in lakeFS. | A branch or a tag are ref expressions. | If &lt;ref&gt; is a ref expression, then: . | &lt;ref&gt;^ is a ref expression referring to its first parent. | &lt;ref&gt;^N is a ref expression referring to its N’th parent; in particular &lt;ref&gt;^1 is the same as &lt;ref&gt;^. | &lt;ref&gt;~ is a ref expression referring to its first parent; in particular &lt;ref&gt;~ is the same as &lt;ref&gt;^ and &lt;ref&gt;~. | &lt;ref&gt;~N is a ref expression referring to its N’th parent, always traversing to the first parent. So &lt;ref&gt;~N is the same as &lt;ref&gt;^^...^ with N consecutive carets ^. | . | . ",

    "content": "The underlying storage is a location in an object store where lakeFS keeps your objects and some immutable metadata. When creating a lakeFS repository, you assign it with a storage namespace. The repository’s storage namespace is a location in the underlying storage where data for this repository will be stored. We sometimes refer to underlying storage as physical. The path used to store the contents of an object is then termed a physical path. Once lakeFS saves an object in the underlying storage it is never modified, except to remove it entirely during some cleanups. A lot of what lakeFS does is to manage how lakeFS paths translate to physical paths on the object store. This mapping is generally not straightforward. Importantly (and contrary to many object stores), lakeFS may map multiple paths to the same object on backing storage, and always does this for objects that are unchanged across versions. lakefs protocol URIs . lakeFS uses a specific format for path URIs. The URI lakefs://&lt;REPO&gt;/&lt;REF&gt;/&lt;KEY&gt; is a path to objects in the given repo and ref expression under key. This is used both for path prefixes and for full paths.

    "content": "Errors with data in production inevitably occur. When they do, they best thing we can do is remove the erroneous data, understand why the issue happened, and deploy changes that prevent it from occurring again. Example 1: RollBack! - Data ingested from a Kafka stream . If you introduce a new code version to production and discover it has a critical bug, you can simply roll back to the previous version. But you also need to roll back the results of running it. Similar to Git, lakeFS allows you to revert your commits in case they introduced low-quality data. Revert in lakeFS is an atomic action that prevents the data consumers from receiving low quality data until the issue is resolved. As previously mentioned, with lakeFS the recommended branching schema is to ingest data to a dedicated branch. When streaming data, we can decide to merge the incoming data to main at a given time interval or checkpoint, depending on how we chose to write it from Kafka. You can run quality tests for each merge (as discussed in the During Deployment section). Alas, tests are not perfect and we might still introduce low quality data to our main branch at some point. In such a case, we can revert the bad commits from main to the last known high quality commit. This will record new commits reversing the effect of the bad commits. Reverting commits using the CLI . lakectl branch revert lakefs://example-repo/main 20c30c96 ababea32 . Note lakeFS version &lt;= v0.33.1 uses ‘@’ (instead of ‘/’) as separator between repository and branch. Example 2: Troubleshoot - Reproduce a bug in production . You upgraded spark and deployed changes in production. A few days or weeks later, you identify a data quality issue, a performance degradation, or an increase to your infra costs. Something that requires investigation and fixing (aka, a bug). lakeFS allows you to open a branch of your lake from the specific merge/commit that introduced the changes to production. Using the metadata saved on the merge/commit you can reproduce all aspects of the environment, then reproduce the issue on the branch and debug it. Meanwhile, you can revert the main to a previous point in time, or keep it as is, depending on the use case . Reading from a historic version (a previous commit) using Spark . // represents the data as existed at commit \"11eef40b\": spark.read.parquet(\"s3://example-repo/11eef40b/events/by-date\") . Example 3: Cross collection consistency . We often need consistency between different data collections. A few examples may be: . | To join different collections in order to create a unified view of an account, a user or another entity we measure. | To introduce the same data in different formats | To introduce the same data with a different leading index or sorting due to performance considerations | . lakeFS will help ensure you introduce only consistent data to your consumers by exposing the new collections and their join in one atomic action to main. Once you consumed the collections on a different branch, and only when both are synchronized, we calculated the join and merged to main. In this example you can see two data sets (Sales data and Marketing data) consumed each to its own independent branch, and after the write of both data sets is completed, they are merged to a different branch (leads branch) where the join ETL runs and creates a joined collection by account. The joined table is then merged to main. The same logic can apply if the data is ingested in streaming, using standard formats, or formats that allow upsert/delete such as Apache Hudi, Delta Lake or Iceberg. ",

    "title": "Using the lakeFS SDK",
    "content": "Installing . Install the Python client using pip: . pip install lakefs . Initializing . The High Level SDK by default will try to collect authentication parameters from the environment and attempt to create a default client. When working in an environment where lakectl is configured it is not necessary to instantiate a lakeFS client or provide it for creating the lakeFS objects. In case no authentication parameters exist, it is also possible to explicitly create a lakeFS client . Here’s how to instantiate a client: . from lakefs.client import Client clt = Client( host=\"http://localhost:8000\", username=\"AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\", password=\"wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\", ) . For testing SSL endpoints you may wish to use a self-signed certificate. If you do this and receive an SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED error message you might add the following configuration to your client: . clt.config.verify_ssl= False . This setting allows well-known “man-in-the-middle”, impersonation, and credential stealing attacks. Never use this in any production setting. Optionally, to enable communication via proxies, simply set the proxy configuration: . clt.config.ssl_ca_cert = &lt;path to a file of concatenated CA certificates in PEM format&gt; # Set this to customize the certificate file to verify the peer clt.config.proxy = &lt;proxy server URL&gt; . Usage Examples . Lets see how we can interact with lakeFS using the High Level SDK. Creating a repository . import lakefs repo = lakefs.repository(\"example-repo\").create(storage_namespace=\"s3://storage-bucket/repos/example-repo\") print(repo) . If using an explicit client, create the Repository object and pass the client to it (note the changed syntax). import lakefs from lakefs.client import Client clt = Client( host=\"http://localhost:8000\", username=\"AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\", password=\"wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\", ) repo = lakefs.Repository(\"example-repo\", client=clt).create(storage_namespace=\"s3://storage-bucket/repos/example-repo\") print(repo) .

    "title": "IO",
    "content": "Great, now lets see some IO operations in action! The new High Level SDK provide IO semantics which allow to work with lakeFS objects as if they were files in your filesystem. This is extremely useful when working with data transformation packages that accept file descriptors and streams. Upload . A simple way to upload data is to use the upload method which accepts contents as str/bytes . obj = branch1.object(path=\"text/sample_data.txt\").upload(content_type=\"text/plain\", data=\"This is my object data\") print(obj.stats()) . Output . {'path': 'text/sample_data.txt', 'physical_address': 's3://storage-bucket/repos/example-repo/data/gke0ignnl531fa6k90p0/ckpfk4fnl531fa6k90pg', 'physical_address_expiry': None, 'checksum': '4a09d10820234a95bb548f14e4435bba', 'size_bytes': 15, 'mtime': 1701865289, 'metadata': {}, 'content_type': 'text/plain'} . Reading the data is just as simple: . print(obj.reader(mode='r').read()) . Output . This is my object data . Now let’s generate a “sample_data.csv” file and write it directly to a lakeFS writer object . import csv sample_data = [ [1, \"Alice\", \"alice@example.com\"], [2, \"Bob\", \"bob@example.com\"], [3, \"Carol\", \"carol@example.com\"], ] obj = branch1.object(path=\"csv/sample_data.csv\") with obj.writer(mode='w', pre_sign=True, content_type=\"text/csv\") as fd: writer = csv.writer(fd) writer.writerow([\"ID\", \"Name\", \"Email\"]) for row in sample_data: writer.writerow(row) . On context exit the object will be uploaded to lakeFS . print(obj.stats()) . Output . {'path': 'csv/sample_data.csv', 'physical_address': 's3://storage-bucket/repos/example-repo/data/gke0ignnl531fa6k90p0/ckpfk4fnl531fa6k90pg', 'physical_address_expiry': None, 'checksum': 'f181262c138901a74d47652d5ea72295', 'size_bytes': 88, 'mtime': 1701865939, 'metadata': {}, 'content_type': 'text/csv'} . We can also upload raw byte contents: . obj = branch1.object(path=\"raw/file1.data\").upload(data=b\"Hello Object World\", pre_sign=True) print(obj.stats()) . Output . {'path': 'raw/file1.data', 'physical_address': 's3://storage-bucket/repos/example-repo/data/gke0ignnl531fa6k90p0/ckpfltvnl531fa6k90q0', 'physical_address_expiry': None, 'checksum': '0ef432f8eb0305f730b0c57bbd7a6b08', 'size_bytes': 18, 'mtime': 1701866323, 'metadata': {}, 'content_type': 'application/octet-stream'} . Uncommitted changes . Using the branch uncommmitted method will show all the uncommitted changes on that branch: . for diff in branch1.uncommitted(): print(diff) .

As expected, our change appears here. Let’s commit it and attach some arbitrary metadata: . ref = branch1.commit(message='Add some data!', metadata={'using': 'python_sdk'}) print(ref.get_commit()) . Output . {'id': 'c4666db80d2a984b4eab8ce02b6a60830767eba53995c26350e0ad994e15fedb', 'parents': ['a7a092a5a32a2cd97f22abcc99414f6283d29f6b9dd2725ce89f90188c5901e5'], 'committer': 'admin', 'message': 'Add some data!', 'creation_date': 1701866838, 'meta_range_id': '999bedeab1b740f83d2cf8c52548d55446f9038c69724d399adc4438412cade2', 'metadata': {'using': 'python_sdk'}} . Calling uncommitted again on the same branch, this time there should be no uncommitted files: . print(len(list(branch1.uncommitted()))) . Output . 0 . Merging changes from a branch into main . Let’s diff between your branch and the main branch: . main = repo.branch(\"main\") for diff in main.diff(other_ref=branch1): print(diff) . Output . {'type': 'added', 'path': 'text/sample_data.txt', 'path_type': 'object', 'size_bytes': 15} {'type': 'added', 'path': 'csv/sample_data.csv', 'path_type': 'object', 'size_bytes': 88} {'type': 'added', 'path': 'raw/file1.data', 'path_type': 'object', 'size_bytes': 18} . Looks like we have some changes. Let’s merge them: . res = branch1.merge_into(main) print(res) # output: # cfddb68b7265ae0b17fafa1a2068f8414395e0a8b8bc0f8d741cbcce1e67e394 . Let’s diff again - there should be no changes as all changes are on our main branch already: . print(len(list(main.diff(other_ref=branch1)))) . Output . 0 . Read data from main branch . import csv obj = main.object(path=\"csv/sample_data.csv\") for row in csv.reader(obj.reader(mode='r')): print(row) . Output . ['ID', 'Name', 'Email'] ['1', 'Alice', 'alice@example.com'] ['2', 'Bob', 'bob@example.com'] ['3', 'Carol', 'carol@example.com'] . Importing data into lakeFS . The new SDK makes it much easier to import existing data from the object store into lakeFS, using the new ImportManager . import lakefs branch = lakefs.repository(\"example-repo\").repo.branch(\"experiment3\") # We can import data from multiple sources in a single import process # The following example initializes a new ImportManager and adds 2 source types; A prefix and an object. importer = branch.import_data(commit_message=\"added public S3 data\") \\ .prefix(\"s3://example-bucket1/path1/\", destination=\"datasets/path1/\") \\ .object(\"s3://example-bucket1/path2/imported_obj\", destination=\"datasets/path2/imported_obj\") # run() is a convenience method that blocks until the import is reported as done, raising an exception if it fails. importer.run() . Alternatively we can call start() and status() ourselves for an async version of the above . import time # Async version importer.start() status = importer.start() while not status.completed or status.error is None: time.sleep(3) # or whatever interval you choose status = importer.status() if status.error: # handle! print(f\"imported a total of {status.ingested_objects} objects!\") . Output . imported a total of 25478 objects! . Transactions . Transactions is a new feature in the High Level SDK. It allows performing a sequence of operations on a branch as an atomic unit, similarly to how database transactions work. Under the hood, the transaction creates an ephemeral branch from the source branch, performs all the operation on that branch, and merges it back to the source branch once the transaction is completed. Transactions are currently supported as a context manager only. import lakefs branch = lakefs.repository(\"example-repo\").repo.branch(\"experiment3\") with branch.transact(commit_message=\"my transaction\") as tx: for obj in tx.objects(prefix=\"prefix_to_delete/\"): # Delete some objects obj.delete() # Create new object tx.object(\"new_object\").upload(\"new object data\") print(len(list(branch.objects(prefix=\"prefix_to_delete/\")))) print(branch.object(\"new_object\").exists()) .

The R S3 client documentation includes full details of the configuration options available.

Note: it is generally best practice to set these environment variables outside of the R script; it is done so here for convenience of the example. In conjunction with this you must also specify region and use_https in each call of an aws.s3 function as these cannot be set globally. For example: . bucketlist( region = \"\", use_https = FALSE ) . | region should always be empty | use_https should be set to TRUE or FALSE depending on whether your lakeFS endpoint uses HTTPS. | . Listing repositories . The S3 gateway exposes a repository as a bucket, and so using the aws.s3 function bucketlist will return a list of available repositories on lakeFS: . bucketlist( region = \"\", use_https = FALSE ) . Writing to lakeFS from R . Assuming you’re using the aws.s3 library there various functions available including s3save, s3saveRDS, and put_object. Here’s an example of writing an R object to lakeFS: . repo_name &lt;- \"example\" branch &lt;- \"development\" s3saveRDS(x=my_df, bucket = repo_name, object = paste0(branch,\"/my_df.R\"), region = \"\", use_https = FALSE) . You can also upload local files to lakeFS using R and the put_object function: . repo_name &lt;- \"example\" branch &lt;- \"development\" local_file &lt;- \"/tmp/never.gonna\" put_object(file = local_file, bucket = repo_name, object = paste0(branch,\"/give/you/up\"), region = \"\", use_https = FALSE) . Reading from lakeFS with R . As with writing data from R to lakeFS, there is a similar set of functions for reading data. These include s3load, s3readRDS, and get_object. Here’s an example of reading an R object from lakeFS: . repo_name &lt;- \"example\" branch &lt;- \"development\" my_df &lt;- s3readRDS(bucket = repo_name, object = paste0(branch,\"/my_data.R\"), region = \"\", use_https = FALSE) . Listing Objects . In general you should always specify a branch prefix when listing objects. Here’s an example to list the main branch in the quickstart repository: . get_bucket_df(bucket = \"quickstart\", prefix = \"main/\", region = \"\", use_https = FALSE) . When listing objects in lakeFS there is a special case which is the repository/bucket level. When you list at this level you will get the branches returned as folders. These are not listed recursively, unless you list something under the branch. To understand more about this please refer to #5441 . Working with Arrow . Arrow’s R library includes powerful support for data analysis, including reading and writing multiple file formats including Parquet, Arrow, CSV, and JSON. It has functionality for connecting to S3, and thus integrates perfectly with lakeFS. To start with install and load the library . install.packages(\"arrow\") library(arrow) . Then create an S3FileSystem object to connect to your lakeFS instance . lakefs &lt;- S3FileSystem$create( endpoint_override = \"lakefs.mycorp.com:8000\", scheme = \"http\" access_key = \"AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\", secret_key = \"wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\", region = \"\", ) . From here you can list the contents of a particular lakeFS repository and branch . lakefs$ls(path = \"quickstart/main\") . To read a Parquet from lakeFS with R use the read_parquet function . lakes &lt;- read_parquet(lakefs$path(\"quickstart/main/lakes.parquet\")) . Writing a file follows a similar pattern. Here is rewriting the same file as above but in Arrow format . write_feather(x = lakes, sink = lakefs$path(\"quickstart/main/lakes.arrow\")) . ",

    "title": "Performing lakeFS Operations using the lakeFS API from R",
    "content": "As well as reading and writing data, you will also want to carry out lakeFS operations from R including creating branches, committing data, and more. To do this call the lakeFS API from the httr library. You should refer to the API documentation for full details of the endpoints and their behaviour. Below are a few examples to illustrate the usage. Check the lakeFS Server Version . This is a useful API call to establish connectivity and test authentication. library(httr) lakefs_api_url &lt;- \"lakefs.mycorp.com:8000/api/v1\" lakefsAccessKey &lt;- \"AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\" lakefsSecretKey &lt;- \"wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\" r=GET(url=paste0(lakefs_api_url, \"/config/version\"), authenticate(lakefsAccessKey, lakefsSecretKey)) . The returned object r can be inspected to determine the outcome of the operation by comparing it to the status codes specified in the API. Here is some example R code to demonstrate the idea: . if (r$status_code == 200) { print(paste0(\"✅lakeFS credentials and connectivity verified. ℹ️lakeFS version \",content(r)$version)) } else { print(\"🛑 failed to get lakeFS version\") print(content(r)$message) } .

As long as there’s a commit taken, the process to reproduce a given state is as simple as reading the data from a path that includes the unique commit_id generated for each commit. To read data at it’s current state, we can use a static path containing the repository and branch names. To give an example, if you have a repository named example with a branch named main, reading the latest state of this data into a Spark Dataframe is always: . df = spark.read.parquet(‘s3://example/main/”) . Note: The code above assumes that all objects in the repository under this path are stored in parquet format. If a different format is used, the applicable Spark read method should be used. In a lakeFS repository, we are capable of taking many commits over the data, making many points in time reproducible. In the repository above, a new commit is taken each time a model training script is run, and the commit message includes the specific run number. If we wanted to re-run the model training script and reproduce the exact same results for a historical run, say run #435, we could copy the commit ID associated with the run and read the data into a dataframe like so: . df = spark.read.parquet(\"s3://example/296e54fbee5e176f3f4f4aeb7e087f9d57515750e8c3d033b8b841778613cb23/training_dataset/”) .

    "title": "Performing Rollbacks with lakeFS",
    "content": "lakeFS lets you develop in your data lake in such a way that rollbacks are simple to perform. This starts by taking a commit over your lakeFS repository whenever a change to its state occurs. Using the lakeFS UI or CLI, you can set the current state, or HEAD, of a branch to any historical commit in seconds, effectively performing a rollback. To demonstrate how this works, let’s take the example of a lakeFS repo with the following commit history: . As can be inferred from the history, this repo is updated every minute with a data sync from some data source. An example data sync is a typical ETL job that replicates data from an internal database or any other data source. After each sync, a commit is taken in lakeFS to save a snapshot of data at that point in time. How to Rollback From a Bad Data Sync? . Say a situation occurs where one of the syncs had bad data and is causing downstream dashboards to fail to load. Since we took a commit of the repo right after the sync ran, we can use a revert operation to undo the changes introduced in that sync. Step 1: Copy the commit_id associated with the commit we want to revert. As the screenshot above shows, you can use the Copy ID to Clipboard button to do this. Step 2: Run the revert command using lakectl, the lakeFS CLI. In this example, the command will be as follows: . lakectl branch revert lakefs://example/main 9666d7c9daf37b3ba6964e733d08596ace2ec2c7bc3a4023ad8e80737a6c3e9d . This will undo the changes introduced by this commit, completing the rollback! . The rollback operation is that simple, even if many changes were introduced in a commit, spanning acrossmultiple data collections. In lakeFS, rolling back data is always a one-liner. ",

    "content": "Operating Systems and ISA . lakeFS can run on MacOS and Linux. Windows binaries are available but not rigorously tested - we don’t recommend deploying lakeFS to production on Windows. x86_64 and arm64 architectures are supported for both MacOS and Linux. Memory and CPU requirements . lakeFS servers require a minimum of 512mb of RAM and 1 CPU core. For high throughput, additional CPUs help scale requests across different cores. “Expensive” operations such as large diff or commit operations can take advantage of multiple cores. Network . If using the data APIs such as the S3 Gateway, lakeFS will require enough network bandwidth to support the planned concurrent network upload/download operations. For most cloud providers, more powerful machines (i.e., more expensive and usually containing more CPU cores) also provide increased network bandwidth. If using only the metadata APIs (for example, only using the Hadoop/Spark clients), network bandwidth is minimal, at roughly 1Kb per request. Disk . lakeFS greatly benefits from fast local disks. A lakeFS instance doesn’t require any strong durability guarantees from the underlying storage, as the disk is only ever used as a local caching layer for lakeFS metadata and not for long-term storage. lakeFS is designed to work with ephemeral disks - these are usually based on NVMe and are tied to the machine’s lifecycle. Using ephemeral disks lakeFS can provide a very high throughput/cost ratio, probably the best that could be achieved on a public cloud, so we recommend those. A local cache of at least 512 MiB should be provided. For large installations (managing &gt;100 concurrently active branches, with &gt;100M objects per commit), we recommend allocating at least 10 GiB - since it’s a caching layer over a relatively slow storage (the object store), see Important metrics below to understand how to size this: it should be big enough to hold all commit metadata for actively referenced commits. lakeFS KV Store . lakeFS uses a key-value database to manage branch references, authentication and authorization information and to keep track of currently uncommitted data across branches. Please refer to the relevant driver tab for best practices, requirements and benchmarks. Storage . The dataset stored in the metadata store is relatively modest as most metadata is pushed down into the object store. Required storage is mostly a factor of the amount of uncommitted writes across all branches at any given point in time: in the range of 150 MiB per every 100,000 uncommitted writes. We recommend starting at 10 GiB for a production deployment, as it will likely be more than enough. | PostgreSQL | DynamoDB | . RAM Since the data size is small, it’s recommended to provide enough memory to hold the vast majority of that data in RAM. Cloud providers will save you the need to tune this parameter - it will be set to a fixed percentage the chosen instance’s available RAM (25% on AWS RDS, 30% on Google Cloud SQL). It is recommended that you check with your selected cloud provider for configuration and provisioning information for you database. For self-managed database instances follow these best practices . Ideally, configure the shared_buffers of your PostgreSQL instances to be large enough to contain the currently active dataset. Pick a database instance with enough RAM to accommodate this buffer size at roughly x4 the size given for shared_buffers. For example, if an installation has ~500,000 uncommitted writes at any given time, it would require about 750 MiB of shared_buffers that would require about 3 GiB of RAM. CPU PostgreSQL CPU cores help scale concurrent requests. 1 CPU core for every 5,000 requests/second is ideal. lakeFS will create a DynamoDB table for you, defaults to on-demand capacity setting. No need to specify how much read and write throughput you expect your application to perform, as DynamoDB instantly accommodates your workloads as they ramp up or down. You can customize the table settings to provisioned capacity which allows you to manage and optimize your costs by allocating read/write capacity in advance (see Benchmarks) . Notes: . | Using DynamoDB on-demand capacity might generate unwanted costs if the table is abused, if you’d like to cap your costs, make sure to change the table to use provisioned capacity instead. | lakeFS doesn’t manage the DynamoDB’s table lifecycle, we’ve included the table creation in order to help evaluating the system with minimal effort, any change to the table beyond the table creation - will need to be handled manually or by 3rd party tools. | .

    "title": "Scaling factors",
    "content": "Scaling lakeFS, like most data systems, moves across two axes: throughput of requests (amount per given timeframe) and latency (time to complete a single request). Understanding latency and throughput considerations . Most lakeFS operations are designed to be very low in latency. Assuming a well-tuned local disk cache (see Storage above), most critical path operations (writing objects, requesting objects, deleting objects) are designed to complete in &lt;25ms at p90. Listing objects obviously requires accessing more data, but should always be on-par with what the underlying object store can provide, and in most cases, it’s actually faster. At the worst case, for directory listing with 1,000 common prefixes returned, expect a latency of 75ms at p90. Managing branches (creating them, listing them and deleting them) are all constant-time operations, generally taking &lt;30ms at p90. Committing and merging can take longer, as they are proportional to the amount of changes introduced. This is what makes lakeFS optimal for large Data Lakes - the amount of changes introduced per commit usually stays relatively stable while the entire data set usually grows over time. This means lakeFS will provide predictable performance: committing 100 changes will take roughly the same amount of time whether the resulting commit contains 500 or 500 million objects. See Data Model for more information. Scaling throughput depends very much on the amount of CPU cores available to lakeFS. In many cases, it’s easier to scale lakeFS across a fleet of smaller cloud instances (or containers) than scale up with machines that have many cores. In fact, lakeFS works well in both cases. Most critical path operations scale very well across machines. ",

    "content": "Below are a few example architectures for lakeFS deployment. Reference Architecture: Data Science/Research environment . Use case: Manage Machine learning or algorithms development. Use lakeFS branches to achieve both isolation and reproducibility of experiments. Data being managed by lakeFS is both structured tabular data, as well as unstructured sensor and image data used for training. Assuming a team of 20-50 researchers, with a dataset size of 500 TiB across 20M objects. Environment: lakeFS will be deployed on Kubernetes. managed by AWS EKS with PostgreSQL on AWS RDS Aurora . Sizing: Since most of the work is done by humans (vs. automated pipelines), most experiments tend to be small in scale, reading and writing 10s to 1000s of objects. The expected amount of branches active in parallel is relatively low, around 1-2 per user, each representing a small amount of uncommitted changes at any given point in time. Let’s assume 5,000 uncommitted writes per branch = ~500k. To support the expected throughput, a single moderate lakeFS instance should be more than enough, since requests per second would be on the order of 10s to 100s. For high availability, we’ll deploy 2 pods with 1 CPU core and 1 GiB of RAM each. Since the PostgreSQL instance is expected to hold a very small dataset (at 500k, expected dataset size is 150MiB (for 100k records) * 5 = 750MiB). To ensure we have enough RAM to hold this, we’ll need 3 GiB of RAM, so, a very moderate Aurora instance db.t3.large (2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM) will be more than enough. An equivalent database instance on GCP or Azure should give similar results. Reference Architecture: Automated Production Pipelines . Use case: Manage multiple concurrent data pipelines using Apache Spark and Airflow. Airflow DAGs start by creating a branch for isolation and for CI/CD. Data being managed by lakeFS is structured, tabular data. The total dataset size is 10 PiB, spanning across 500M objects. The expected throughput is 10k reads/second + 2k writes per second across 100 concurrent branches. Environment: lakeFS will be deployed on Kubernetes. managed by AWS EKS with PostgreSQL on AWS RDS . Sizing: Data pipelines tend to be bursty in nature: reading in a lot of objects concurrently, doing some calculation or aggregation, and then writing many objects concurrently. The expected amount of branches active in parallel is high, with many Airflow DAGs running per day, each representing a moderate amount of uncommitted changes at any given point in time. Let’s assume 1,000 uncommitted writes/branch * 2500 branches = ~2.5M records. To support the expected throughput, looking the benchmarking numbers above, we’re doing roughly 625 requests/core, so 24 cores should cover our peak traffic. We can deploy 6 * 4 CPU core pods. On to the PostgreSQL instance - at 500k, the expected dataset size is 150MiB (for 100k records) * 25 = 3750 MiB. To ensure we have enough RAM to hold this, we’ll need at least 15 GiB of RAM, so we’ll go with a db.r5.xlarge (4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM) Aurora instance. An equivalent database instance on GCP or Azure should give similar results. ",

Alternatively, you can pass these configuration values when adding a step. For example: . aws emr add-steps --cluster-id j-197B3AEGQ9XE4 \\ --steps=\"Type=Spark,Name=SparkApplication,ActionOnFailure=CONTINUE, \\ Args=[--conf,spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.bucket.example-repo.access.key=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE, \\ --conf,spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.bucket.example-repo.secret.key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY, \\ --conf,spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.bucket.example-repo.endpoint=https://example-org.us-east-1.lakefscloud.io, \\ --conf,spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access=true, \\ s3a://&lt;lakefs-repo&gt;/&lt;lakefs-branch&gt;/path/to/jar]\" . With this configuration set, you read S3A paths with example-repo as the bucket will use lakeFS, while all other buckets will use AWS S3. Usage . Here’s an example for reading a Parquet file from lakeFS to a Spark DataFrame: . val repo = \"example-repo\" val branch = \"main\" val df = spark.read.parquet(s\"s3a://${repo}/${branch}/example-path/example-file.parquet\") . Here’s how to write some results back to a lakeFS path: . df.write.partitionBy(\"example-column\").parquet(s\"s3a://${repo}/${branch}/output-path/\") . The data is now created in lakeFS as new changes in your branch. You can now commit these changes or revert them. Configuring Azure Databricks with the S3-compatible API . If you use Azure Databricks, you can take advantage of the lakeFS S3-compatible API with your Azure account and the S3A FileSystem. This will require installing the hadoop-aws package (with the same version as your hadoop-azure package) to your Databricks cluster. Define your FileSystem configurations in the following way: . spark.hadoop.fs.lakefs.impl=org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem spark.hadoop.fs.lakefs.access.key=‘AKIAlakefs12345EXAMPLE’ // The access key to your lakeFS server spark.hadoop.fs.lakefs.secret.key=‘abc/lakefs/1234567bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY’ // The secret key to your lakeFS server spark.hadoop.fs.lakefs.path.style.access=true spark.hadoop.fs.lakefs.endpoint=‘https://example-org.us-east-1.lakefscloud.io’ // The endpoint of your lakeFS server . For more details about Mounting cloud object storage on Databricks. Configuring Databricks SQL Warehouse with the S3-compatible API . A SQL warehouse is a compute resource that lets you run SQL commands on data objects within Databricks SQL. If you use Databricks SQL warehouse, you can take advantage of the lakeFS S3-compatible API with the S3A FileSystem. Define your SQL Warehouse configurations in the following way: . | In the top right, select Admin Settings and then SQL warehouse settings. | Under Data Access Configuration add the following key-value pairs for each lakeFS repository you want to access: . | . spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.impl shaded.databricks.org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.bucket.example-repo.access.key AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE // The access key to your lakeFS server spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.bucket.example-repo.secret.key wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY // The secret key to your lakeFS server spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.bucket.example-repo.endpoint https://example-org.us-east-1.lakefscloud.io // The endpoint of your lakeFS server spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.bucket.example-repo.path.style.access true . | Changes are applied automatically after the SQL Warehouse restarts. | You can now use the lakeFS S3-compatible API with your SQL Warehouse, e.g.: | . SELECT * FROM delta.`s3a://example-repo/main/datasets/delta-table/` LIMIT 100 . ",

To enable the app, in the Azure portal navigate to Azure Active Directory &gt; Enterprise applications and select the app. Then on the Properties page toggle Visible to users? to Yes. Add a secret . Sometimes called an application password, a client secret is a string value your app can use in place of a certificate to identity itself. Steps: . | In the Azure portal, in App registrations, select your application. | Select Certificates &amp; secrets &gt; Client secrets &gt; New client secret. | Add a description for your client secret. | Select an expiration for the secret or specify a custom lifetime. | Client secret lifetime is limited to two years (24 months) or less. You can’t specify a custom lifetime longer than 24 months. | Microsoft recommends that you set an expiration value of less than 12 months. | . | Select Add. | Record the secret’s value for use in your client application code. This secret value is never displayed again after you leave this page. | . Add a redirect URI . A redirect URI is the location where the Microsoft identity platform redirects a user’s client and sends security tokens after authentication. You add and modify redirect URIs for your registered applications by configuring their platform settings. Enter https://lakefs-cloud.us.auth0.com/login/callback as your redirect URI. Settings for each application type, including redirect URIs, are configured in Platform configurations in the Azure portal. Some platforms, like Web and Single-page applications, require you to manually specify a redirect URI. For other platforms, like mobile and desktop, you can select from redirect URIs generated for you when you configure their other settings. Steps: . | In the Azure portal, in App registrations, select your application. | Under Manage, select Authentication. | Under Platform configurations, select Add a platform. | Under Configure platforms, select the web option. | Select Configure to complete the platform configuration. | . Once you finish registering lakeFS Cloud with Azure AD send the following items to the Treeverse’s team: . | Client ID | Client Secret | Azure AD Domain | Identity API Version (v1 for Azure AD or v2 for Microsoft Identity Platform/Entra) | .

Once set up is complete, you will of course be able to use lakeFS Delta Sharing on existing and on new tables without further assistance. 1. Collect data and initial setup . | Select a Delta Sharing configuration URL. This is a single location on lakeFS to hold the top-level configuration of lakeFS Delta Sharing across all repositories of your organization. Typically, it will have the form lakefs://REPO/main/lakefs_delta_sharing.yaml for one of your repositories. A longer path may be supplied - however, we do recommend keeping it on the main branch, as this object represents state for the entire installation. | Create a user lakefs-delta-sharing-service for lakeFS Delta Sharing, and an access key for that user. It should have at least read permissions for the configuration URL and for all repositories and all data accesses by Unity. lakeFS Delta Sharing will these credentials to communicate with lakeFS. | . Communicate these items to Customer Success: . | Configuration URL | Access key ID and secret access key for user lakefs-delta-sharing-service. | . Note: All YAML files extensions used in this guide must be yaml. Do not use a yml extension instead. 2. Initial configuration . Select a secret authorization token to share Unity catalog. Unity catalog will use to authenticate to the lakeFS Delta Sharing server. You might use this command on Linux: . head -c 50 /dev/random | base64 . Create a file lakefs_delta_sharing.yaml and place it at the config URL selected above. It should look like this: . authorization_token: \"GENERATED TOKEN\" # Map lakeFS repositories to Unity shares repositories: - id: sample-repo share_name: undev # List branches and prefixes to export. Each of these branches (and only # these branches) will be available as a schema on Unity. branches: - main - staging - dev_* - id: repo2 share_name: share_two branches: - \"*\" . Note that a plain “*” line must be quoted in YAML. Upload it to your config URL. For instance if the config URL is lakefs://repo/main/lakefs_delta_sharing.yaml, you might use: . lakectl fs upload -s ./lakefs_delta_sharing.yaml lakefs://repo/main/lakefs_delta_sharing.yaml . 3. Connect Unity to lakeFS Delta Sharing! . You now need to configure Unity to use the lakeFS Delta Sharing server. Create a share provider file config.share.json; see the Delta Sharing manual: . { \"shareCredentialsVersion\": 1, \"endpoint\": \"https://ORG_ID.REGION.lakefscloud.io/service/delta-sharing/v1\", \"bearerToken\": \"GENERATED TOKEN\", \"expirationTime\": \"2030-01-01T00:00:00.0Z\" } . “GENERATED TOKEN” is the secret authorization token use above. Install the databricks cli. We will use it to create Delta Share on Unity. Follow the instructions to configure it. Run the provider creation command: . databricks unity-catalog providers create \\ --name lakefs-cloud \\ --recipient-profile-json-file config.share.json . Go to “Data » Delta Sharing” on the DataBricks environment. Once Treeverse have configured lakeFS Delta Sharing on your account with your config URL, the “lakefs-cloud” provider should appear under “Shared with me”. Click the provider to see its shares. You can now create a catalog from these shares. And you can see schemas for each of the branches that you configured in the share. Here branch name dev_experiment1 matches the pattern dev_* that we defined in the configuration object lakefs-delta-sharing.yaml, so it appears as a schema. At this point you have configured Delta Sharing on lakeFS, and DataBricks to communicate with lakeFS delta sharing. No further Treeverse involvement is required. Updates to lakefs_delta_sharing.yaml will update within a minute of uploading a new version. 4. Configure tables . Everything is ready: lakeFS repositories are configured as shares, and branches are configured as schemas. Now you can define tables! Once a repository is shared, its tables are configured as a table descriptor object on the repository on the path _lakefs_tables/TABLE.yaml. Delta Lake tables . Delta Lake format includes full metadata, so you only need to configure the prefix: . name: users type: delta path: path/to/users/ . Note: The filename of the ‘yaml’ file containing the table definition must match the ‘name’ of the table itself. In the example above, ‘_lakefs_tables/users.yaml’. When placed inside _lakefs_tables/users.yaml this defines a table users on the prefix path/to/users/ (so path/to/users/ holds the prefix _delta_log). Hive tables . Hive metadata server tables are essentially just a set of objects that share a prefix, with no table metadata stored on the object store. You need to configure prefix, partitions, and schema. name: clicks type: hive path: path/to/clicks/ partition_columns: ['year'] schema: type: struct fields: - name: year type: integer nullable: false metadata: {} - name: page type: string nullable: false metadata: {} - name: site type: string nullable: true metadata: comment: a comment about this column . Useful types recognized by DataBricks Photon include integer, long, short, string, double, float, date, and timestamp. For exact type mappings, and whether to specify a field as nullable: false, refer to DataBricks Photon documentation. ",

The updated configuration should look as such: . --- database: type: \"postgres\" postgres: connection_string: \"postgres://localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable\" max_open_connections: 20 . | Deploy (or run) the new version of lakeFS. | . lakeFS 0.30.0 or greater . In case migration is required, you first need to stop the running lakeFS service. Using the lakefs binary for the new version, run the following: . lakefs migrate up . Deploy (or run) the new version of lakeFS. Note that an older version of lakeFS cannot run on a migrated database. Prior to lakeFS 0.30.0 . Note: with lakeFS &lt; 0.30.0, you should first upgrade to 0.30.0 following this guide. Then, proceed to upgrade to the newest version. Starting version 0.30.0, lakeFS handles your committed metadata in a new way, which is more robust and has better performance. To move your existing data, you will need to run the following upgrade commands. Verify lakeFS version == 0.30.0 (can skip if using Docker) . lakefs --version . Migrate data from the previous format: . lakefs migrate db . Or migrate using Docker image: . docker run --rm -it -e LAKEFS_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING=&lt;database connection string&gt; treeverse/lakefs:rocks-migrate migrate db . Once migrated, it is possible to now use more recent lakeFS versions. Please refer to their release notes for more information on ugrading and usage). If you want to start over, discarding your existing data, you need to explicitly state this in your lakeFS configuration file. To do so, add the following to your configuration (relevant only for 0.30.0): . cataloger: type: rocks . ",

Older commits are rarely accessed, while newer commits are accessed very frequently, a tiered storage approach can work very well - the object store is the source of truth, while local disk and even RAM can be used to cache the more frequently accessed ones. Since they are immutable - once cached, you only need to evict them when space is running out. There’s no complex invalidation that needs to happen. In terms of storage format, commits are be stored as SSTables, compatible with RocksDB. SSTables were chosen as a storage format for 3 major reasons: . | Extremely high read throughput on modern hardware: using commits representing a 200m object repository (modeled after the S3 inventory of one of our design partners), we were able to achieve close to 500k random GetObject calls / second. This provides a very high throughput/cost ratio, probably as high as can be achieved on public clouds. | Being a known storage format means it’s relatively easy to generate and consume. Storing it in the object store makes it accessible to data engineering tools for analysis and distributed computation, effectively reducing the silo effect of storing it in an operational database. | The SSTable format supports delta encoding for keys which makes them very space efficient for data lakes where many keys share the same common prefixes. | . Each lakeFS commit is represented as a set of contiguous, non-overlapping SSTables that make up the entire keyspace of a repository at that commit. ",

Each Key/Value pair (“ValueRecord”) is constructed of a key, identity, and value. A simple identity could be, for example, a sha256 hash of the value’s bytes. It could be any sequence of bytes that uniquely identifies the value. As far as the Graveler is concerned, two ValueRecords are considered identical if their key and identity fields are equal. A Graveler file itself is content-addressable, i.e., similarly to Git, the name of the file is its identity. File identity is calculated based on the identity of the ValueRecords the file contains: . valueRecordID = h(h(valueRecord.key) || h(valueRecord.Identity)) fileID = h(valueRecordID1 + … + valueRecordIDN) .

    "content": "We have two additional requirements for the storage format: . | Be space and time efficient when creating a commit - assuming a commit changes a single object out of a billion, we don’t want to write a full snapshot of the entire repository. Ideally, we’ll be able to reuse some data files that haven’t changed to make the commit operations (in both space and time) proportional to the size of the difference as opposed to the total size of the repository. | Allow an efficient diff between commits which runs in time proportional to the size of their difference and not their absolute sizes. | . To support these requirements, we decided to essentially build a 2-layer Merkle tree composed of a set of leaf nodes (“Range”) addressed by their content address, and a “Meta Range”, which is a special range containing all ranges, thus representing an entire consistent view of the keyspace: . Assuming commit B is derived from commit A, and only changed files in range e-f, it can reuse all ranges except for SSTable #N (the one containing the modified range of keys), which will be recreated with a new hash representing the state as exists after applying commit B’s changes. This will, in turn, also create a new Metarange since its hash is now changed as well (as it is derived from the hash of all contained ranges). Assuming most commits usually change related objects (i.e., that are likely to share some common prefix), the reuse ratio could be very high. We tested this assumption using S3 inventory from 2 design partners - we partitioned the keyspace to an arbitrary number of simulated blocks and measured their change over time. We saw a daily change rate of about 5-20%. Given the size of the repositories, it’s safe to assume that a single day would translate into multiple commits. At a modest 20 commits per day, a commit is expected to reuse &gt;= 99% of the previous commit blocks, so acceptable in terms of write amplification generated on commit. On the object store, ranges are stored in the following hierarchy: . &lt;lakefs root&gt; _lakefs/ &lt;range hash1&gt; &lt;range hash2&gt; &lt;range hashN&gt; ... &lt;metarange hash1&gt; &lt;metarange hash2&gt; &lt;metarange hashN&gt; ... &lt;data object hash1&gt; &lt;data object hash2&gt; &lt;data object hashN&gt; ... Note: This relatively flat structure could be modified in the future. Looking at the diagram above, it imposes no real limitations on the depth of the tree. A tree could easily be made recursive by having Meta Ranges point to other Meta Ranges - and still provide all the same characteristics. For simplicity, we decided to start with a fixed 2-level hierarchy. ",

However, the lakeFS object metadata might be stored in either the object store or a key-value store.

This is also true for “refs” - in particular, branches, which are simply pointers to an underlying commit, are modified frequently: on every commit or merge operation. Both these types of metadata are not only mutable, but also require strong consistency guarantees while also being fault tolerant. If we can’t access the current pointer of the main branch, a big portion of the system is essentially down. Luckily, this is also much smaller set of metadata compared to the committed metadata.
